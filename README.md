THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS PROJECT IS TO FETCH Wordpress Posts using wordpress api, clean it up with Nextjs and present it via /blogs and /blogs:slug

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/blogs](http://localhost:3000/blogs) with your browser to see the result.
